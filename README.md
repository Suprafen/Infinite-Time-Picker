# Infinite-Time-Picker

This inifinite time picker was made in pure code without any third party libraries.

Each component(column) has predefined amount of rows. This amount of rows helps to achieve pseudo-infinite scrolling.

I used delegate-protocol method to return a time result in seconds, from this picker. However you can return a final number without delegate, it's up to you.
